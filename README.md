# SEOInspectorAI™ by Webmaster Eric — Master of the Web

SEOInspectorAI™ is a **free, open-source SEO audit tool** that analyzes websites and returns actionable insights for creators, small businesses, and brand owners.

This is not a generic SEO scanner.  
This is **my personal audit logic**, refined over **17 years of real-world webmastering**, now available publicly.

## 🚀 What This Tool Does

- Scans any URL (via the Python engine)
- Checks titles, descriptions, H1 structure
- Estimates content depth and word count
- Flags missing essentials (title, meta description, canonical)
- Produces a human-readable report (JSON) displayed via GitHub Pages

The GitHub Pages front-end shows the **latest** audit report generated by the engine.

## 🟣 Why I Built This

I'm Eric — **Webmaster Eric**, digital marketing king, Master of the Web.

Creators and business owners kept asking me:

> “Is my SEO good?”

The internet is full of outdated, scammy tools and fake “free scans.”  
So I built a clean, transparent, educational SEO engine anyone can use.

## 🛠 How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. You (or I) run the Python engine on a URL.
2. The engine writes `engine/sample_report.json`.
3. The GitHub Pages UI (`index.html` + `script.js`) reads that file and displays a clean SEO report.

Future improvements could include:

- Running audits on multiple URLs and saving history
- Adding Lighthouse-based performance checks
- Integrating basic keyword suggestions from `data/keywords.json`
- Exporting reports as downloadable files
