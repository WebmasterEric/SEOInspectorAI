# SEOInspectorAI™ by Webmaster Eric — Master of the Web

SEOInspectorAI™ is a **free, open-source SEO audit tool** that analyzes websites and returns actionable insights for creators, small businesses, and brand owners.

This is not a generic SEO scanner.  
This is **my personal audit logic**, refined over **17 years of real-world webmastering**, now available publicly.

## 🚀 What This Tool Does

- Scans any URL (via the engine)
- Checks titles, descriptions, headers
- Estimates content depth and structure
- Flags missing basics (title, meta description, canonical, etc.)
- Gives human-readable fixes you can implement today

The GitHub Pages front-end shows the latest audit report generated by the engine.

## 🟣 Why I Built This

I'm Eric — **Webmaster Eric**, digital marketing king, Master of the Web.

Creators and business owners kept asking me one question:

> “Is my SEO good?”

The internet is full of outdated, scammy tools and fake “free scans.”  
So I built a clean, transparent, educational SEO engine anyone can use.

## 🛠 How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. You (or I) run the Python engine on a URL.
2. The engine writes `engine/sample_report.json`.
3. The GitHub Pages UI reads that file and displays a clean, simple SEO report.

Later, this can evolve into:
- Multiple saved reports
- Advanced rules
- Keyword suggestions
- Competitor checks
- Full-blown SaaS-style interface
